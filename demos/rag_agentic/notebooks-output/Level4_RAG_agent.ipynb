    "# Level 4: RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example of executing queries with a RAG agent in Llama Stack. It shows how to initialize an agent with the RAG tool provided by Llama Stack and to invoke it such that retrieval from a vector DB is activated only when necessary. The notebook also covers document ingestion using the RAG tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple (non-agentic) RAG tutorial, please refer to [Level1_simple_RAG.ipynb](./Level1_simple_RAG.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting to a llama stack server.\n",
    "2. Indexing a collection of documents into a vector DB for later retrieval.\n",
    "3. Initializing the agent capable of retrieving content from vector DB via tool use.\n",
    "4. Launching the agent and using it to answer user queries about the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "- Followed the instructions in the [Setup Guide](./Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb) notebook. \n",
    "- Llama Stack server should be using milvus as its vector DB provider.\n"

The\\n15\\ndocumentation at crc.dev/crc has more information about this subject.\\n7.2. Hardware Requirements\\nIn terms of hardware, OpenShift Local has some strict requirements. Your system must use a recent\\nIntel CPU (except for Macs, where Apple Silicon machines are supported) with at least four physical\\ncores and have at least 16 GB of RAM. Be aware that the base installation of OpenShift Local\\nrequires at least 9 GB free to start. Of course, to run other applications on OpenShift Local, you will\\nneed more RAM, so using a computer with at least 32 GB of RAM is strongly recommended.\\nOpenShift Local also requires at least 35 GB of free disk space for its installation. The memory\\nrequirements are likely to increase in the future, so please check the documentation at crc.dev for\\nmore up-to-date information.\\n7.3. Installation\\nTo install OpenShift Local, open your web browser and navigate to console.redhat.com/openshift/\\ncreate/local . Download the latest release of OpenShift Local and the \"pull secret\" file. The latter is a\\nfile containing a key identifying your copy of OpenShift Local to your Red Hat Developer account.\\nUnzip the file containing the OpenShift Local executable, and using your terminal, run the\\ncommand crc setup . This command will prepare your copy of OpenShift Local, verifying\\nrequirements and setting the required configuration values.\\nOnce the crc setup command is ready, launch crc start. Running crc start can take a long time,\\naround 20 minutes, on a recent PC.\\nOnce started, access the OpenShift Web Console with the crc console command, which will open\\nyour default browser. OpenShift Local uses the developer username and password to log in as a\\nlow-privilege user, while the kubeadmin user uses a random-generated password. Use the crc\\nconsole --credentials command to find the credentials required to log in as the kubeadmin user.\\nOpenShift Local allows developers to perform various everyday tasks as if it were a standard\\nOpenShift cluster, like deploying applications\\n'</span>,\n",

Is Red Hat OpenShift Open Source?\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a commercial product based on an open-source project called OKD. This\\nacronym means \" OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution\" and is publicly available for everyone to\\ninspect and contribute. Like the upstream Kubernetes project, OKD developers use the Go\\nprogramming language.\\n3.3. How can I run OpenShift?\\nToday, Red Hat OpenShift is available through various mechanisms and formats:\\n• DevOps teams can install it in their data centers \"on-premise.\"\\n• Major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud offer managed\\nRed Hat OpenShift installations.\\n• Developers can either run OpenShift locally on their workstations using Red Hat OpenShift\\nLocal, also known as CRC or \"Code-Ready Containers\"\\n• They can also request a 30-day trial OpenShift cluster, offered by Red Hat, at no charge, for\\ntesting and evaluation purposes.\\nRed Hat OpenShift is an integrated Platform-as-a-Service for enterprise users based on Kubernetes.\\nIt is tightly integrated with advanced security settings, developer tooling, and monitoring\\nmechanisms, allowing DevOps teams to be more productive.\\n8\\nChapter 4. OpenShift-only Custom Resource\\nDefinitions\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a complete DevOps platform extending Kubernetes in various ways. It bundles\\na constellation of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to make the life of developers and cluster\\nadministrators easier.\\nLet us talk first about the CRDs only available on OpenShift.\\n4.1.

The\\n15\\ndocumentation at crc.dev/crc has more information about this subject.\\n7.2. Hardware Requirements\\nIn terms of hardware, OpenShift Local has some strict requirements. Your system must use a recent\\nIntel CPU \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mexcept for Macs, where Apple Silicon machines are supported\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with at least four physical\\ncores and have at least 16 GB of RAM. Be aware that the base installation of OpenShift Local\\nrequires at least 9 GB free to start. Of course, to run other applications on OpenShift Local, you will\\nneed more RAM, so using a computer with at least 32 GB of RAM is strongly recommended.\\nOpenShift Local also requires at least 35 GB of free disk space for its installation. The memory\\nrequirements are likely to increase in the future, so please check the documentation at crc.dev for\\nmore up-to-date information.\\n7.3. Installation\\nTo install OpenShift Local, open your web browser and navigate to console.redhat.com/openshift/\\ncreate/local . Download the latest release of OpenShift Local and the \"pull secret\" file. The latter is a\\nfile containing a key identifying your copy of OpenShift Local to your Red Hat Developer account.\\nUnzip the file containing the OpenShift Local executable, and using your terminal, run the\\ncommand crc setup . This command will prepare your copy of OpenShift Local, verifying\\nrequirements and setting the required configuration values.\\nOnce the crc setup command is ready, launch crc start. Running crc start can take a long time,\\naround 20 minutes, on a recent PC.\\nOnce started, access the OpenShift Web Console with the crc console command, which will open\\nyour default browser. OpenShift Local uses the developer username and password to log in as a\\nlow-privilege user, while the kubeadmin user uses a random-generated password. Use the crc\\nconsole --credentials command to find the credentials required to log in as the kubeadmin user.\\nOpenShift Local allows developers to perform various everyday tasks as if it were a standard\\nOpenShift cluster, like deploying applications\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",
