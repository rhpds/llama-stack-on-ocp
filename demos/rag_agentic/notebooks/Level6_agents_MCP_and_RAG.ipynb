To do this, we will instantiate a ReAct agent (which is included in the llama stack python client by default). The ReAct agent is a variant of the simple agent but with the ability to loop through \"Reason then Act\" iterations, thinking through the problem and then using tools until it determines that it's task has been completed successfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike prompt chaining which follows fixed steps, ReAct dynamically breaks down tasks and adapts its approach based on the results of each step. This makes it more flexible and capable of handling complex, real-world queries effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below you will see the slight differences in the agent definition and the prompt used to accomplish our task."

We do so by initializing an agent while giving it access to the MCP tools, and RAG tool configured with Llama Stack, then invoking the agent on the specified query.
